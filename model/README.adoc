# List of operation behaviours

* LIST
** *owner*: relation
** *description*: get list of instances (return type can be single/many based on cardinality of relation)
*** access relation: get list of target transfer object type (filtered by attribute of target mapped transfer object type)
*** derived relation: get result of expression represented as target transfer object type (filtered by attibute of target mapped transfer object type is also added)
*** stored relation: get result of stored relation (filtered by attibute of target mapped transfer object type is also added)
*** mapped relation: get result based on resolved mapping
*** transient relation: not supported

* CREATE_INSTANCE
** *owner*: relation
** *description*: create a new instance (restricted by filter attribute of mapped transfer object type), new instance is attached if relation type is stored;
*** access relation: permission is based on CREATE flag of access relation
*** stored relation: permission is based on CREATE flag of producer (relation/operation)
*** mapped relation: get result based on resolved mapping
*** derived relation: not supported
*** transient relation: not supported

* VALIDATE_CREATE
** *owner*: relation
** *description*: validate input data of a CREATE_INSTANCE operation, rollback on completion
*** access relation: permission is based on CREATE flag of access relation
*** stored relation: permission is based on CREATE flag of producer (relation/operation)
*** mapped relation: get result based on resolved mapping
*** derived relation: not supported
*** transient relation: not supported

* REFRESH
** *owner*: mapped transfer object type
** *description*: refresh (reload) a mapped transfer object type instance

* UPDATE_INSTANCE
** *owner*: mapped transfer object type
** *description*: update attributes of a mapped transfer object type; permission is based on UPDATE flag of producer (relation/operation)

* VALIDATE_UPDATE
** *owner*: mapped transfer object type
** descripton: validate input data of UPDATE_INSTANCE operation, rollback on completion

* DELETE_INSTANCE
** *owner*: mapped transfer object type
** *description*: delete mapped transfer object type instance; permission is based on DELETE flag of producer (relation/operation)

* SET_REFERENCE
** *owner*: relation
** *description*: set reference of subject to a given value (both single and many relations are supported), permission is based on UPDATE flag of subject

* UNSET_REFERENCE
** *owner*: relation
** *description*: unset (single, non composition) reference of subject, permission is based on UPDATE flag of subject

* ADD_REFERENCE
** *owner*: relation
** *description*: add existing instance(s) to (many, non composition) reference of subject, permission is based on UPDATE flag of subject

* REMOVE_REFERENCE
** *owner*: relation
** *description*: remove existing instance(s) to (many, non composition) reference of subject, permission is based on UPDATE flag of subject

* GET_RANGE
** *owner*: relation
** *description*: get range of (non composition) reference of subject, permission is based on CREATE/UPDATE flag of subject

* GET_PRINCIPAL
** *owner*: actor type
** *description*: get principal (transfer object type representation) of actor (logged in user)
* MAP_PRINCIPAL
** *owner*: actor type
** *description*: map logged in user info (OAuth 2.0 token data) to principal (transfer object type representation) of actor (logged in user)

* GET_TEMPLATE
** *owner*: transfer object type
** *description*: return transfer object type instance filled with default values (not persisted in case of mapped transfer object type)
** not supported yet
